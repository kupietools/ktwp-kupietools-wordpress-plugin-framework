# ktwp-kupietools-wordpress-plugin-framework
Empty scaffolding of a WordPress plugin containing basic functions for KupieTools admin area settings, popup sheet, UI tabs, and/or shortcode. Created for my own use, but, hey, go nuts.

As of this writing (2025jul17) this should be considered alpha software. Not all functions have been tested yet.
